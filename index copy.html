        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Rosa Lee Carter was born in Bluemont, Virginia. She earned her BA in elementary education from Storer College in West Virginia. She began her long teaching career in Loudoun at Powell's Grove in 1927. She then taught at Grant School in Middleburg, Virginia in the 1930's. Her first impression of teaching school was not a pleasant one. She noted that the disparities between black and white schools were to be a great challenge. She taught in adverse conditions, such as cold overcrowded classrooms, no water, leaky roofs and a lack of funds for books and necessities.<br><br><br><br>

                    <p> Spelling bees are the most well-known spelling competitions which take place all over the world. Even though they are essentially designed for children, most adults would struggle with some of the words which the lovely young contestants have to deal with in these competitions. Winning a spelling bee is hard, but not impossible.</p>
